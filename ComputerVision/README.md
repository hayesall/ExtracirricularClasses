# Computer Vision Notes

**Quick Intro**: So far I'm pulling notes heavily from three books by Wilhelm Burger and Mark James Burge:

- [Principles of Digital Image Processing: Fundamental Techniques](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-84800-191-6)
- [Principles of Digital Image Processing: Core Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-84800-195-4)
- [Principles of Digital Image Processing: Advanced Methods](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-84882-919-0)
